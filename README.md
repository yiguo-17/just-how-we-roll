# Just How We Roll

### Introduction

Today you'll be making an app that combines all the fun of rolling dice with all the fun of tracking the average rolls so far. These are equal funs.

[The app is hosted here.](https://just-how-we-roll.surge.sh)


### Tools Left Behind

There's been some code left behind in this other-wise gutted app: a random number generator and an array sorter. Use them!

### Tools We'll Be Practicing With

* event listeners
* string building/interpolation
* array management and iteration
* maths


### Setting Up

**Event Listeners**

Here's where you'll query your UI elements the user interacts with and add event listener functions. For now, leave the functions themselves blank. We'll come back to them.

The UI elements are: the dice images should have click event listeners to run its respective "roll functions", and the rest button should have a click listener to reset all data and the interface.

Again, leave the functions themselves empty right now!


**Resetting/Setting Starting Images**

Let's fill in that reset function we left blank. It will need to:

1. empty all four global roll arrays
2. change the dice buttons back to their starting images (in the `start` sub-directory of our `images` directory!)
3. change the text in our mean/media/mode text areas to nothing (what's the "no value" for a string?)

Once you've got that function declared, call it. We want to make sure we always start out with a fresh slate of images.


### Roll Functions

Each of your roll event listener functions needs to:

* Calculate a random number from 1 to the maximum number for that die (a helper function has been left behind for you on that one). For now, it's a good idea to `console.log` that result.
*  Change the image of the dice roll "button" to the results, using the images in the `d6` and `numbers` directories. PLEASE NOTE the file names. They all have filenames that you can use to _dynamically_ set which image it should be based on the result of the die roll. That is, if they roll a 3, you can look for `3.png` and make that the source for their dice roll button. If they rolled a 5, you'll need `5.png`. Notice a pattern? Use it!
*  Add the result of the roll into its respective array (left behind for you in the global scope) so that we can track our results for that kind of die. Although we shouldn't do it in production, it's not a bad idea to `console.log` each result as we go.

Once you've got that going, it's time for some maths:


### Some Maths

The DOM manipulation is harder than what you've done so far, for sure, but the hardest part of this project is calculating the mean, median and mode. We _highly_ recommend making helper functions for each of these that take in an array as input and spit out one number as output.Also, mode is really hard; consider that one a stretch goal!

Some tips:

* Run each of these function each time you've rolled a new result.
* Feel free to skip around if you're finding one too hard, but mean is easiest for most people and mode is hardest.
* For median, you're going to want to sort the numbers. This is a solved problem and relatively easy in JavaScript, but we've also included a helper function that can return a sorted version of whatever number-filled array you pass it.
* For the mode, think about storing how many times you've seen each number in an object and tracking which is the highest number as you go.


### Good luck!

Good luck _indeed_.
